  "reasoning": "STRATEGIC TRADING PLAN FOR NOVEMBER 21, 2025 - CEO DIRECTIVE\n\nCAPITAL ALLOCATION AUTHORIZED:\n- Total Deployment: Up to $14,000 (14% of capital)\n- Position 1 (NVDA): $7,000 max (post-earnings momentum, AI chip demand thesis)\n- Position 2 (SQ): $7,000 max ($5B buyback catalyst, fintech rotation thesis)\n- Cash Reserve: $84,901 (86% dry powder maintained)\n\nSTRATEGIC THESIS:\nPlay AI/Fintech strength (NVDA, SQ) while avoiding Retail/EV weakness (TSLA, TGT). This is a stock-picker's market, not broad index environment. Sector selection matters more than market timing.\n\nEXECUTION FRAMEWORK:\n1. 8:00 AM - Daedalus risk assessment (approval required)\n2. 8:30 AM - Stratagem setup identification (≥7/10 quality threshold)\n3. 9:00 AM - CEO capital allocation decision\n4. 9:45 AM - Entry window (post opening-range formation)\n5. Stops: NVDA -9% ($175), SQ -12% ($76.50)\n6. Profit targets: +25% for 50% position reduction\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT:\n- Max loss per position: NVDA -$630, SQ -$840\n- Max portfolio loss: -$1,470 (within -$1,500 daily limit)\n- No day trades (PDT constraint: 8/3, must hold overnight)\n- 60-minute cooling between trades\n- Stops set immediately upon fill\n\nCONTINGENCY PLANS:\n- If no ≥7/10 setups: Stand down entirely (capital preservation IS success)\n- If only one setup quality: Deploy $7K only, maintain 93% cash\n- If both stop out: Cease trading immediately, 10-min cooling, Daedalus review\n- If market gaps significantly: Wait for stabilization, don't chase\n\nSUCCESS METRICS:\n- Process scorecard ≥6/7 (discipline over P&L)\n- All parameter constraints honored\n- All advisor approvals obtained\n- All vetoes accepted without override\n- Transaction costs <$30 (limit orders only)\n\nSTRATEGIC INTENT:\nCapture alpha on high-conviction, catalyst-driven setups while maintaining institutional discipline. Not forcing trades - waiting for edge to be clear, then striking with size and conviction.\n\nThis plan balances offense (capital deployment on quality setups) with defense (86% cash reserve, tight stops, governance structure). Success = executing the plan with discipline, regardless of outcome.",
