  "reasoning": "Multi-agent analysis resulted in modified trading plan for 2025-11-21. CEO proposed $14K dual-position strategy. Daedalus identified critical options math error (4x risk underestimation) and psychological traps. Stratagem vetoed SQ (data quality failure 4/10) and conditionally approved NVDA (7.5/10) with reduced sizing. Final plan: Single NVDA position $5K max (reduced from $7K), conditional entry 9:45-10:00 AM only if all 5 conditions met. Most likely outcome: NO TRADE (60% probability). Success defined by process discipline, not P&L.",
