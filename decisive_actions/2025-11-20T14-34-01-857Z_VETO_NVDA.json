  "symbol": "NVDA",
  "reasoning": "STRATEGIC VETO: NVDA Position Denied at Market Open\n\nPRIMARY VIOLATIONS:\n- Condition #6: Gap chase risk (+3.6% gap exceeds 2% threshold)\n- Condition #9: Timing failure (9:32 AM vs. recommended 48-hour wait)\n- Condition #7: Psychological pressure (action bias after 3-day inactivity)\n\nENTRY QUALITY DETERIORATION:\n- Approved entry range: $186-188 (yesterday's close proximity)\n- Actual market price: $193-194 (+3.7% premium to baseline)\n- Risk/reward materially worsened—paying for consensus news\n\nRISK FACTORS:\n- Chasing gap into post-earnings euphoria (classic FOMO setup)\n- Crowd positioning: bullish consensus = edge erosion\n- SPY at $673 (late-stage rally risk, macro fragility)\n- IV compression and theta decay post-gap likely underestimated\n\nBEAR CASE (3 Scenarios for -15% Drop):\n1. Profit-taking rotation within 48 hours (retracement to $165-170)\n2. Macro shock (Fed pivot, China tariffs, credit event)\n3. AI skepticism resurfaces (guidance miss, competitor catalyst)\n\nRECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVES:\nA. Gap-and-fade wait (11:00-11:30 AM retracement to $188-190)\nB. 48-hour discipline (Thursday 6 PM re-evaluation per original plan)\nC. Pass entirely (preserve capital, await next quality setup)\n\nOVERRIDE PARAMETERS (If User Ignores Veto):\n- Reduce size to $2,500 (50% cut)\n- Tighten stop to -5% (max loss $125-150)\n- Exit by 3 PM if no follow-through above $195\n- NO averaging down if position moves against\n\nDECISION INTEGRITY: This veto protects against impulsive execution that violates pre-stated risk parameters. Capital preservation > forced activity.",
