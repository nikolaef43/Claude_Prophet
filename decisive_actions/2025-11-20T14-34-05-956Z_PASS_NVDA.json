  "reasoning": "4/10 setup - HARD PASS on NVDA $195C/$200C Dec 19. Critical flaws: (1) Zero OI/volume across all strikes indicates post-earnings data lag and execution risk, (2) Chasing 3.7% gap into strength without consolidation, (3) Light volume (40K in 30min) lacks institutional confirmation, (4) 29 DTE barely meets minimum. Delta/spread metrics acceptable but liquidity risk is unacceptable for $5K position. Would reconsider at 10:30-11AM if: OI >1000, volume >500, consolidation at $192-194, breakout above $194.50 on volume surge. This is gap chase with unverified execution - not Stratagem's game.",
