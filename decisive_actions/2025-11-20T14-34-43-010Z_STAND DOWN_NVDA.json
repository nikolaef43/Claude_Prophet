  "reasoning": "DUAL VETO - Governance system rejected trade execution at 9:32 AM. Daedalus: VETO due to gap chase violation (3.7% gap exceeds 2% threshold from yesterday's conditions), timing discipline broken (entering at open vs waiting for consolidation), and detected psychological pressure. Stratagem: 4/10 HARD PASS due to zero open interest on options (data hasn't refreshed post-earnings), zero volume on contracts, and chasing gap with insufficient volume validation (only 40K in 30 min). Both agents independently determined this is not the setup that was conditionally approved yesterday. Recommendation: Wait for consolidation, recheck at 10:30-11 AM when options data refreshes and price action clarifies.",
