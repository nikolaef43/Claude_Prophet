  "reasoning": "Straddle request post-earnings gap (+3.7%) vetoed. Options chain returned zero contracts (data failure). Strategic timing failure: IV crush post-earnings makes straddle expensive relative to realized move. Would need 7%+ additional move from $195 to break even on ~$14 straddle cost. Post-event volatility plays are -EV. If directional conviction exists, single-leg preferable. If no conviction, no trade. Data infrastructure + strategic timing = hard veto.",
