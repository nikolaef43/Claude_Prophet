  "reasoning": "SECOND VETO - User proposed NVDA straddle 3 minutes after directional call veto. Both agents independently rejected. Stratagem: STRATEGIC VETO - (1) Options chain returning zero contracts (cannot price or execute), (2) Post-earnings straddle timing is inverted (straddles bought BEFORE events for IV expansion, not after 3.7% gap when IV crushed), (3) Math doesn't work - estimated $14 straddle cost requires 7%+ move ($181 or $209) just to break even. Daedalus: RATIONALIZATION NOT STRATEGY - (1) Strategy shopping to bypass veto (3-min pivot suspicious), (2) Action bias confirmed (wants exposure because NVDA moved, not because edge exists), (3) No new information justifies structure change, (4) If NVDA gapped down would different structure be proposed? Psychology unchanged. Recommendation: Stand down from NVDA entirely. Build proper pre-earnings straddle framework for future use.",
