  "reasoning": "CEO recommended WMT (+4.8% earnings gap, $105.40 entry). Daedalus vetoed: Gap chase psychology identical to NVDA despite different sector. Key issues: (1) 4.8% gap already prices in earnings beat + guidance raise, (2) Entering after news digested not before, (3) 1.8% stop too tight given 4.8% move (profit-taking risk), (4) If strong will consolidate for better entry at $104. Recommendation: Pass on day-of entry, wait for pullback to $103.50-104 support. Same structural flaw as NVDA - paying premium for news already priced in. This is FOMO not edge.",
