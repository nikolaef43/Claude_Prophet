Entry: $670.50, Stop: $669.50 (-0.15%), Target: $672.50-673 (+0.3-0.4%). Risk/reward: 2.5:1. This is range trading in sideways market - not chasing momentum, but exploiting defined boundaries. Volume light (1,810 on latest 5-min bar), suggesting range will hold. Deploying $10K (15 shares). CEO noted no edge in gap-chases, but THIS is mean-reversion edge at proven support level.",
