  "reasoning": "Stop hit on range bounce play. Entered SPY at $670.07 targeting support bounce to $672.50. SPY failed to hold support, dropped to $669.45 (at stop level $669.50). Range breakdown confirmed - no bounce occurred. Honoring stop discipline. Loss: ~$9.30 on $10,051 position (-0.09%). This validates CEO assessment: no clear directional edge in current market. Range support broke rather than held. Exit now to preserve capital.",
