  "reasoning": "User reported \"SPY dropped from $670 to $658 (-1.8%)\" as a breakdown opportunity. Actual data shows:\n\n1. SPY closed yesterday (11/19) at $662.63, not $670\n2. Current extended hours price is $657.71 (~0.7% down, not -1.8%)\n3. Price is trading WITHIN yesterday's range ($658.74-$667.34), not breaking structure\n4. Extended hours volume is thin and non-institutional\n5. Dec 20 options chain returned zero contracts (data unavailable)\n6. No clean technical setup: no volume confirmation, no support break, no momentum\n\nSupport levels to watch: $655 (Nov 18 low), $650 (psychological), $645 (air pocket).\n\nThis is noise, not a trade. Will reassess during regular market hours if $655 breaks on volume with clean options chain available.",
