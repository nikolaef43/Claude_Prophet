SPY currently $658, needs to drop 2.8% ($18) to hit strike. Break-even: $638.40. Probability of profit: 84% (delta -0.16). If SPY stays above $640 tomorrow, keep full $160 premium. If assigned, own SPY at effective cost of $638.40 (still profitable vs current $658). This captures theta decay in sideways market per user request for advanced options strategies.",
