  "reasoning": "Attempted 4-phase multi-strategy deployment but discovered critical API limitation: only 0DTE (Nov 21) options available, no access to December monthly chains needed for defensive spreads. Cannot execute defensive positioning (Phase 1) as planned. Stratagem correctly vetoed execution to prevent inappropriate 0DTE gamma exposure. \n\nOptions: 1) Fix API access to monthly options, 2) Pivot to strategies that work with available tools (managed positions, stock trades), 3) Defer complex options strategies until proper infrastructure available.\n\nCurrent successful positions: 44 short put contracts + 3 SPY put hedges still active and working as intended.",
