  "reasoning": "## WHAT IS ACTUALLY WORKING\n\n**Stratagem Performance:**\n✅ Created comprehensive strategic plans (Nov 21: $14K allocation, NVDA/SQ thesis)\n✅ Multi-agent collaboration (worked with Daedalus to modify plan, reduce risk)\n✅ Effective vetoes (NVDA gap chase, straddle attempts, WMT)\n✅ Successful premium selling execution (44 short put contracts, +$62 net)\n✅ Identified infrastructure constraints (0DTE API limitation)\n✅ High-quality scoring system (7.5/10 NVDA, 4/10 SQ veto)\n\n**What's Working:**\n1. Premium selling strategy: 67% win rate, +$62 on small capital\n2. Veto/governance system: Prevented multiple -EV trades\n3. Strategic planning: Detailed pre-market analysis\n4. Risk management: Stopped execution when conditions not met\n\n**What NEEDS Fixing:**\n- Agents still wait for user to initiate trading sessions\n- No autonomous scheduled operations (e.g., 9:30 AM scan → execute)\n- Inter-agent communication exists but requires user to trigger it\n- No proactive position management (e.g., \"SPY hedge bleeding, recommending close\")\n\n**The Real Issue:** Agents ARE capable and active, but they're in REACTIVE mode. They respond well to user prompts but don't have autonomous trading loops.",
