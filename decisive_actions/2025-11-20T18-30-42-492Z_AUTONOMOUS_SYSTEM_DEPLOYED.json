  "reasoning": "## AUTONOMOUS MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM DEPLOYMENT\n\n**Problem Corrected:**\nAgents (especially Stratagem) were performing excellently but operating in REACTIVE mode - waiting for user commands instead of autonomous operation.\n\n**Evidence of Stratagem Performance:**\n- ✅ Strategic planning (Nov 21: $14K allocation, NVDA/SQ thesis)\n- ✅ Multi-agent collaboration (modified plans with Daedalus input)\n- ✅ Effective vetoes (5 vetoes: NVDA gap chase, straddle, WMT, etc.)\n- ✅ Successful execution (44 short put contracts, +$62, 67% win rate)\n- ✅ Infrastructure awareness (identified 0DTE API limitation)\n\n**What Was Fixed:**\nNot agent quality → Operational structure\n\n**New System Deployed:**\n\n1. **3-Tier Authority System:**\n   - Tier 1 ($0-$2K): Agents execute autonomously, no approval\n   - Tier 2 ($2K-$10K): Multi-agent consensus (2/3 vote), auto-execute\n   - Tier 3 (>$10K): User approval required\n\n2. **6 Daily Sessions:**\n   - 8:00 AM: Morning Intelligence (Paragon: Trade or stand down?)\n   - 9:15 AM: Pre-Market Scanning (Stratagem finds setups)\n   - 9:45 AM: Market Open Execution (Execute Tier 1/2)\n   - 12:00 PM: Midday Review (Position management)\n   - 2:00 PM: Afternoon Opportunity (Second window)\n   - 3:45 PM: End of Day (Close/hold + summary)\n\n3. **Inter-Agent Collaboration:**\n   - Stratagem → Daedalus → Paragon (no user mediation)\n   - Agents spawn each other via Task tool\n   - Consensus voting on Tier 2 trades\n   - User notified AFTER execution (Tier 1/2), not asked for approval\n\n4. **Process Over Profit:**\n   - Daily scorecard: ≥6/7 required\n   - Discipline matters more than P&L\n   - Stand down is success if no quality setups\n\n**Files Created:**\n- autonomous_daily_trading.md (main prompt)\n- run_daily_autonomous.sh (execution script)\n- com.prophet.trading.daily.plist (launchd schedule)\n- setup_daily_autonomous.sh (installer)\n- AUTONOMOUS_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md (full documentation)\n\n**Paragon & Daedalus Assessments:**\n- Both agents identified structural issues (not capability issues)\n- Both recommended autonomous authority tiers\n- Both emphasized inter-agent collaboration without user\n- Both pressure-tested the new framework\n\n**User Role Changed:**\n- FROM: Day trader executing every decision\n- TO: Strategic supervisor reviewing outcomes\n\n**Next Action:**\nRun ./setup_daily_autonomous.sh to activate system\n\n**Start Date:**\nNext trading day (Monday-Friday automatic)",
