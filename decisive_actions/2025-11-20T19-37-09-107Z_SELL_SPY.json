  "reasoning": "DAMAGE CONTROL - Closing SPY 663C calls (10 contracts) at -$1,000 loss (-16%). Calls are $7 OTM with SPY at $656, expiring Friday 11/28. Market intelligence bearish, zero probability of recovery. This is dead capital that should be redeployed or preserved. Theta bleeding $100+/day with no edge. Institutional discipline: accept the loss, stop the bleeding, preserve capital for better opportunities. Keeping SPY 649P as defensive hedge (only -3%, has value in bearish market). Total portfolio loss reduced from -$1,636 to approximately -$636 after this closure.",
