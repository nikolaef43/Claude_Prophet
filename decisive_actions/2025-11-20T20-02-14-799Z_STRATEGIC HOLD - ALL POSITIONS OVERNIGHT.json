  "reasoning": "CRITICAL EOD DECISION (3:45 PM EST):\n\nDECISION: HOLD ALL POSITIONS OVERNIGHT\n\nRATIONALE - INSTITUTIONAL DISCIPLINE:\n\n1. SPY $649P HEDGE (13 contracts, -$1,362):\n   - Loss improved from -$1,492 to -$1,362 (+$130) in 1 hour\n   - 8 days to expiration - adequate time value remaining\n   - Current loss is 17% (within acceptable hedge cost range of 15-25%)\n   - Closing now = crystallizing -$1,362 loss with zero protection\n   - Market intelligence shows bearish sentiment building\n   - Risk/reward favors holding: $1,362 at risk vs $8,000+ protection if market gaps down\n   - VERDICT: HOLD - This is functioning as intended portfolio insurance\n\n2. SHORT PUTS (44 contracts total, -$160):\n   - All strikes now OTM (MARA $10.61, RIOT $13.21)\n   - Positions improved significantly into close\n   - Expected theta decay overnight: +$150-200 (working in our favor)\n   - 8 days to expiration - well within safe zone\n   - Closing now = giving up $3,078 max profit for $160 loss avoidance\n   - Risk/reward heavily favors holding\n   - VERDICT: HOLD ALL - Let theta work, monitor pre-market\n\n3. OVERNIGHT RISK ASSESSMENT:\n   - Total capital at risk: $9,246 (market value of all positions)\n   - Worst case scenario (5% probability): -$1,500 additional loss\n   - Base case (60% probability): -$50 to +$100 net\n   - Bull case (35% probability): +$200 to +$500 net\n   - Expected value calculation: Slightly positive\n   - Risk is asymmetric in our favor given position structure\n\n4. PROCESS DISCIPLINE:\n   - No forced liquidation at unfavorable prices into close\n   - Positions are performing directionally as intended\n   - We have adequate time and capital cushion\n   - $92,311 cash reserve provides substantial buffer\n   - Portfolio value $96,429 vs starting ~$99,000 = 2.6% drawdown (well within limits)\n\n5. TOMORROW'S PLAN:\n   - 8:00 AM pre-market intelligence session\n   - Monitor MARA/RIOT for any overnight crypto movement\n   - Evaluate SPY hedge performance\n   - Decision point: Trade or stand down based on market conditions\n   - Exit triggers established for short puts if crypto drops below strike prices\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT:\n- Current drawdown: 2.6% (limit is 15%)\n- Overnight exposure: 4.3% of portfolio value\n- All positions have defined max loss\n- No assignment risk (all puts OTM)\n- Adequate liquidity for tomorrow\n\nFINAL VERDICT: HOLD ALL POSITIONS. EXECUTE NO CLOSING TRADES.\n\nMarket close in 10 minutes. Positions will be monitored pre-market tomorrow at 8:00 AM EST.",
