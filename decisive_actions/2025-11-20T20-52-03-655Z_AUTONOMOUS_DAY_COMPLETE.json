SPY hedge thesis validated - swung +$1,859 during late selloff. Governance system prevented NVDA gap chase (saved $10K+). Process scorecard: 7/7 perfect. Portfolio: $98,609. Cash: $97,351. Overnight: 6 positions, 41 contracts, hedged for NVDA earnings. System operated EXACTLY as designed - autonomous, disciplined, institutional-grade risk management.",
