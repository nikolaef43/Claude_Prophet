  "reasoning": "Day trade count maxed (25/25) eliminates tactical flexibility. Bearish market sentiment with Bitcoin weakness directly threatens MARA/RIOT short puts. Cannot enter positions we cannot exit. Portfolio is already positioned with SPY hedge providing downside protection. Risk/reward for new trades is asymmetric and unfavorable. Maximum realistic loss scenario is -$800 (0.8% of portfolio), which is acceptable. Will monitor opening prices and reassess at market open if crypto names collapse.",
