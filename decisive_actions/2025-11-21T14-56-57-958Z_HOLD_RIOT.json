  "reasoning": "RIOT $13P position is ITM by $0.40 but retains $0.59 of time value across 7 days to expiration. Theta decay favors holding. Break-even at $12.34 vs current $12.60 provides cushion. Assignment risk is manageable (600 shares at $12.34 effective). Total portfolio unrealized loss of -$655 is 0.67% - well within tolerance. Will reassess if RIOT drops below $11.50 or loss exceeds -$400.",
