  "reasoning": "Friday afternoon scan complete. No setups meet 8/10 quality threshold for execution. Key factors: (1) NVDA earnings tonight creates binary risk across tech sector, (2) Friday afternoon timing means weekend theta decay hurts any new long premium positions, (3) Existing crypto exposure (MARA/RIOT shorts) already underwater - avoid adding risk, (4) SPY showing strength but no clear breakout pattern worth weekend carry risk. Discipline requires standing down when edge is unclear. Will reassess Monday after NVDA earnings digested.",
