  "reasoning": "EMERGENCY EXIT - MARA $10P CLOSED AT $10.02\n\nTRIGGER CONDITION MET: MARA breached $10.00 strike level as specified in Session 4 risk parameters.\n\nSITUATION ANALYSIS:\n- MARA trading at $10.02/$10.03 (essentially AT strike)\n- Dropped -2.6% in 1 hour from $10.28 to $10.01\n- Friday 2h45m before close - weekend gap risk unacceptable\n- Crypto sector weakness confirmed by RIOT correlation\n- Position -38.5% underwater (-$170 unrealized)\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT:\n- Downside risk: Additional -$330 if MARA drops to $9.50 over weekend\n- Upside potential: Save $170 if miraculous recovery\n- Risk/Reward: 1.94:1 against us\n- Weekend exposure: 2.75 days of unmanageable price action\n\nINSTITUTIONAL DISCIPLINE APPLIED:\n- Stop loss trigger activated\n- Proximity to strike (0.2%) makes this binary risk\n- Already absorbed -$216 RIOT loss today\n- Capital preservation paramount on Friday afternoon\n- Expected value calculation heavily favors exit\n\nDECISION: Close MARA $10P x10 market order\n- Crystallized loss: ~-$170\n- Eliminates primary at-risk position\n- Preserves capital for Monday opportunities\n\nREMAINING EXPOSURE:\n- MARA $9.5P x10 remains open (-$110 unrealized)\n- Has $0.50 buffer (5% move needed to threaten)\n- Materially different risk tier - acceptable weekend hold\n\nThis is textbook risk management. When you're at strike on Friday afternoon with clear bearish momentum, you exit. No emotion, no hope - process over outcome.",
