  "reasoning": "DOUBLING DOWN on PLTR Nov 28 $150 Put. Already up +$300 on 12 contracts. Buying 24 MORE contracts at $3.30 for ~$7,920. Bearish thesis getting stronger: Burry bearish, CEO selling $95M, stock weak into close. Total position will be 36 contracts. If PLTR drops to $145, puts worth $5+ = massive gain. Max risk on new position: $7,920. This is high conviction bet on continued PLTR weakness.",
