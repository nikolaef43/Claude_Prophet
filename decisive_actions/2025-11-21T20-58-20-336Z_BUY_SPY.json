  "reasoning": "BUYING SPY Jan 16 $660 Call x10 contracts for recovery play. SPY crashed to $658.52 today - excellent entry. 56 DTE gives plenty of time for market bounce. Cost ~$19,780. If SPY recovers to $670 by January, calls worth $25+ = +$5,200+ profit. Delta 0.534 ATM positioning. This balances our bearish short-term positions with bullish medium-term recovery bet.",
