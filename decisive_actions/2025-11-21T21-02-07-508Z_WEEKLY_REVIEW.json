  "reasoning": "Comprehensive CEO-level weekly review covering portfolio performance, strategy effectiveness, lessons learned, and forward planning for week of Nov 18-21, 2025. Portfolio declined from $98,901 to $94,585 (-4.4% / -$4,316). Key findings: Governance system worked (prevented NVDA gap chase losses), premium selling strategy failed (crypto correlation risk), scalping experiments unprofitable (-$83), hedging strategy saved portfolio ($962 realized on SPY puts). Major issues: excessive day trading (26/25 PDT), undisciplined experimentation, correlation risk in short puts. Recommendations: Pause premium selling, focus on high-conviction directional trades only, strict adherence to 7-day DTE minimum, maximum 2 positions simultaneously, rebuild process discipline.",
