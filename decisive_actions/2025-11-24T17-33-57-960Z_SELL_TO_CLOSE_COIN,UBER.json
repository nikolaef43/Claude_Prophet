  "reasoning": "Closing short-dated options expiring 11/28 to lock in profits and reduce theta risk. COIN showing +35% profit ($1,475) with 4 days to expiry - taking profits before theta decay accelerates. UBER barely ITM with -5% loss and acquisition uncertainty - cutting position to redeploy capital into stronger setups. Both positions had insufficient conviction to hold through expiration.",
