  "reasoning": "Opening scalp positions on strong intraday momentum. TSLA up $5 today (+1.2%) with \"Must Own\" rating and Musk AI chip upside catalyst - buying 8x 12/5 $420C @ $15.07 (ATM, delta 0.51, $12,056 allocation) for 11-day scalp. SPY near highs - buying 10x 12/19 $670C @ $11.93 (near ATM, delta 0.51, $11,930 allocation) for 25-day scalp. Total scalp deployment: $23,986. Strategy: Hold for 10-20% gains on momentum continuation, stop at -5% if momentum reverses. Longer expiries (11-25 days) protect from theta decay while capturing intraday momentum. Will monitor and exit quickly on profit targets.",
