  "reasoning": "Deploying $42K into SPY ITM scalps 3+ weeks out per user directive. Closed all TSLA positions and pivoting to more stable SPY momentum. Opening 2 ITM positions: 1) 12/19 $656C x10 @ $22.27 (delta 0.68, $13 ITM, $22,270), 2) 12/19 $652C x8 @ $25.36 (delta 0.72, $17 ITM, $20,288). Total deployment: $42,558. SPY at $669 showing strong momentum (+23% on long-term hold). ITM options provide built-in downside protection with high delta for scalp profits. 25 days until expiration provides theta cushion. Will monitor every 30 seconds for 5-15% scalp exits.",
