  "reasoning": "Took profits on half of December SPY calls (+$2,110 in realized gains captured). Rolled proceeds into longer-dated January 2026 positions: 5x NVDA $175C (52 days) and 5x SPY $675C (66 days). This extends duration, maintains bullish exposure, and locks in some profits from the morning rally. Portfolio now has better time diversification across Dec, Jan, and March expirations.",
