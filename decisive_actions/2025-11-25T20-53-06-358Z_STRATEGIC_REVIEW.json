  "reasoning": "CEO-level strategic review of November 25, 2025 trading performance. Portfolio gained +$4,900 (5.1%) from $97K to $102K through disciplined profit-taking, strategic reallocation, and tactical scalping. Key decisions: (1) Morning profit-taking on December SPY calls locked $2,110 realized gains, (2) Deployed $18.8K into 7 long-dated positions (52 DTE) across tech/crypto sectors, (3) Closed all 3 DTE scalps to eliminate theta decay, realizing $255+ on AMD while cutting losers at breakeven. Portfolio now holds 13 positions with proper time diversification (Dec/Jan/Mar expirations), $24K cash reserves (23.6%), and reduced concentration risk. Strategic assessment: Process execution excellent, capital allocation appropriate given market conditions, risk management discipline maintained. However, tech concentration remains elevated at 54% of portfolio (6 positions: NVDA, AMD, PLTR, TSLA, COIN, MSTR), requiring monitoring into year-end volatility. Recommended actions: Consider profit-taking on AMD (+20.5%) and December SPY winners (+17-22%) to rebuild cash reserves toward 30%, maintain hedging discipline as only 1 put held against 5 SPY call positions, continue scalping discipline with 3-5 DTE exits before close to avoid theta traps.",
