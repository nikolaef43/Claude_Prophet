  "reasoning": "Cutting QQQ 11/28 $613C scalp at -$960 (-15.6%). QQQ dropped from $612.86 to $611.91 in 5 minutes, option went from $3.08 to $2.60. Tech sector weakness despite market open strength. SPY holding better. With only 3h 15m to close and 2 DTE theta decay accelerating, taking disciplined stop loss. Better to lock small loss than risk it going to -30%+ in low volume Thanksgiving session. SPY scalp still +$90, keeping that runner.",
