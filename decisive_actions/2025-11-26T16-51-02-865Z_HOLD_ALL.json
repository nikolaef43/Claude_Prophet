All 7 positions profitable with gains ranging from 13.5% to 45.2%. All positions are 51-114 DTE with no theta decay risk over the 4-day Thanksgiving weekend. Technical momentum remains strong across all holdings. Cash position at 61.6% provides excellent flexibility post-holiday. No tactical reason to close profitable positions before the holiday. Holding all positions through the weekend.",
