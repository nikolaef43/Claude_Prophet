  "reasoning": "Holding all 17 options positions overnight. Late day selloff appears to be end-of-day positioning rather than fundamental shift. LEAPS (Jan/Mar 2026) remain profitable with ample time. Dec 19 positions have 17 DTE - sufficient time for recovery if SPY/QQQ bounce. SOUN is biggest risk at -31% but still has 45 DTE. No action warranted - patience required.",
