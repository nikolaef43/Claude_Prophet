Only concerns: COIN short position slightly against us (-2%), AVGO down 10%. Fed rate decision this week is major catalyst. Will monitor for: 1) Take profit opportunities on big winners (PLTR, RKLB, META), 2) COIN short squeeze risk if crypto rallies, 3) Entry opportunities on any dips. Waiting for market open at 9:30 AM to assess price action and momentum.",
