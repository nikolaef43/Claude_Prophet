  "symbol": "NVDA251212C00182500",
  "reasoning": "TAKING PROFIT on NVDA momentum scalp. Entered at $4.90, now targeting $5.90 exit = +20.4% gain ($500 profit on $2,450 cost basis in under 5 minutes). NVDA rallied from $184.33 to $185.56 (+0.7%), but options gained 20% due to high delta (0.607) and gamma expansion. Discipline: Taking profit at pre-determined 20% target. This frees up $2,950 in capital for next scalp. Will look for PLTR or SPY momentum continuation plays.",
