  "reasoning": "Exiting both morning scalps. NVDA recovered to breakeven - taking scratch trade (0% P&L, $0 profit). PLTR failed to hold momentum, down -11% ($350 loss). Total scalp session: -$350. Lesson: Morning volatility after strong gap requires wider stops or better entries. Fed week uncertainty causing choppy action. Will wait for clearer momentum before next scalp. Still have strong portfolio with winners: META +52%, PLTR Jan +88%, RKLB +107%.",
