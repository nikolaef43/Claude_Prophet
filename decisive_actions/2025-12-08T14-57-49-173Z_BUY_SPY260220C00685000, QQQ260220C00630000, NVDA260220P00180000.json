  "reasoning": "DEPLOYING CAPITAL - Feb 2026 options (2.5 months, no day trade issues). Strategy: Playing both sides. BULLISH: SPY $685C x10 ($20,910) + QQQ $630C x5 ($11,220) = $32,130 long exposure betting on Fed cut rally. BEARISH HEDGE: NVDA $180P x5 ($5,360) protects against tech pullback given \"AI stocks losing quality status\" news and rotation to small caps. Total deployed: $37,490 of $41,715 cash. Balanced approach with directional bias toward market up but hedged.",
