  "reasoning": "Taking partial profit on RKLB calls - up 119% (+$1,710). Selling 2 of 3 contracts to lock in gains. Keeping 1 contract for continued upside. Smart risk management: secure exceptional gains while maintaining exposure. Fed decision Wednesday could provide further catalyst but also risk - reducing position size is prudent.",
