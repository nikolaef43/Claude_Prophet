  "reasoning": "Taking profit on RKLB $42 Jan calls at +306% gain. Position is deep ITM ($62.88 vs $42 strike) with intrinsic value of $20.88. Option trading at $19.50 has captured most of its value. Exceptional return that must be locked in - 306% gains are rare and holding risks giving back profits on any pullback.",
