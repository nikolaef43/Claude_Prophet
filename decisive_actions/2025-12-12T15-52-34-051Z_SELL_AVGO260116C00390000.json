  "reasoning": "Cutting AVGO $390 Jan calls at -64% loss. Broadcom earnings disappointed on AI backlog and margin guidance despite revenue beat. Stock plunged to $365.54 vs $390 strike (6.7% OTM). With only 35 days to expiration, thesis is broken. Salvaging remaining $2,110 value rather than risking total loss. Risk management requires cutting broken trades.",
