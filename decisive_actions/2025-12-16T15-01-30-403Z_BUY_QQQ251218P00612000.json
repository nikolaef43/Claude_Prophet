  "reasoning": "Adding QQQ 612P scalp to complement SPY puts. Got 24 SPY puts at $3.48 (double fill). Now adding 10 QQQ 612P at $4.24. Delta -0.48 for good downside sensitivity. QQQ at $610.8, if it dips to $609-610 these spike. Spending $4,240. Target: $5.00+ for 18% gain, stop $3.50 if market rips. Doubling down on volatility scalp strategy.",
